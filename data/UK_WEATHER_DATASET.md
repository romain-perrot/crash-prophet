#### UK Weather Dataset Description
Dataset of the weather in the UK : published by the MET Office recording the weather in 32 different localisations. This dataset has 8 features. However, we will need to sort the data because the records start from 1850.
- year: Year in which the measurements were taken. We will only keep the part we need.
- month: Month in which the measurements were taken. This is a numerical data.
- tmax: Mean daily maximum temperature (°C). This is a numerical data.
- tmin: Mean daily minimum temperature (°C). This is a numerical data.
- af: Days of air frost recorded that month (days). This is a numerical data.
- rain: Total rainfall (mm). This is a numerical data.
- sun: Total sunshine duration (hours). This is a numerical data.
- station: Station location where measurement was recorded. This is a non numerical data, then we will need to change that.
