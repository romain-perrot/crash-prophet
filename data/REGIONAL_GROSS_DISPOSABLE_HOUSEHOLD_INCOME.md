#### Regional Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) Dataset Description

Dataset of the regional gross disposable household income (GDHI): city regions in the UK. Published by the office for National Statistics, this dataset display the income of the household sector.

The Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) is the amount of money that all of the individuals in the household sector have available for spending or saving after they have paid direct and indirect taxes and received any direct benefits. These estimates relate to totals for all individuals within the household sector for a region rather than to an average household or family unit. GDHI per head are estimates of values for each person, not each household.

- Geo code: associated with a city region
- Area name: city region where the GDHI were calculated
- Year: time mesure for the GDHI's calcuation
- Table1: total GDHI at current basic prices, pounds million
- Table2: total resident population numbers, persons
- Table3: GDHI per head of population at current basic prices, pounds
- Table4: GDHI per head as indices, UK equals 100
- Table5: annual growth in total GDHI, percentage
- Table6: annual growth in GDHI per head of population, percentage
- Table12: Combined authority and city region areas

All these attributes (year, Table1 to 6) are numerical data except for Geo code, Area name and Tabl12 that is an input string.
Difficult to work with and we would have to review each attributes and combine them more accuratly in one dataset.
